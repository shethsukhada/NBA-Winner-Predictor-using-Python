Built a predictive model using Decision trees to find the NBA game winner.
Improved the results by adding additional features by Feature engineering.

Used random forest algorithm to overcome the probability of Overfitting in case of decision trees.
Trained model with various features, estimators to finally gain the accuracy of 67.4%.

Used model selection of GridSearchCV to even find the best high performing model which yielded 67.4% of accuracy.

Libraries Used -
- Pandas and Numpy for data cleansing and modelling.
- Scikit-learn for model building.
- RandomForestClassifier for random forest and DecisionTreeClassifier for decision tree classification.
